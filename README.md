Wilmer Flores Player Analysis 2015-2024

Wilmer Flores has had a rough start to the 2024 MLB season after being the best hitter on the San Francisco Giants in 2023. With this drastic of a decline, it is worth examining his offensive output and determining what is responsible using Pandas and Matplotlib. The visuals provided convey the decline, as well as what has changed in his approach. 

At the time this is posted, he had a 2 homerun game against the Texas Rangers on 6/7/24, so he may be returning back to his average production. Overall, the biggest concerns are his decline in exit velocity, tendency to pull the ball, and high ground ball rate. He is still a strong veteran presence on the team and gives a professional at-bat every plate appearance. There is still about 2/3 of the season to go, so despite the early concerns I believe he will find his swing and provide meaningful production for the Giants down the line.
